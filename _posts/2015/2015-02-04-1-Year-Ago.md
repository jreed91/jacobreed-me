One year ago I wrote [this post](http://jacobreed.me/2014/05/09/Dad.html), on the day my father passed away. While this past year has been one of a lot of sadness, it also has brought new challenges and achievements. I [graduated college](http://jacobreed.me/2014/05/20/Graduation.html), began my career at HNI and ran the [Bix 7](http://bix7.com/2014/results/index.php?get=results&name=reed&race=2014-bix&submit=Search) for the first time. But, with the absence of my father it was difficult to make up for him not being around. As I wrote 1 year ago:

> He was Mr. Fix-It around our house. If one of our cars needed fixing he could do it. If the stove broke he would be the one we call. On top of all this, he was the one that cooked and cleaned.

Trying to fill this void was difficult since I'm not the handiest person. But we always had a friend or family member there to help out whenever something needed fixed and I can't thank them enough for this. 

I know my father would not want me to spend this day laying around being depressed. So instead, I want to use this post to provide resources and information about the disease that ultimately killed him. I'm hoping that someone out there can take this information and make a change in their own life, so that they don't have to suffer from this terrible disease.


## What is Melanoma
Melanoma is usually a cancer of the skin but sometimes can be found in the eyes or in the mucous membranes. Many factors can lead to melanoma, including, your family history, genetics, and environmental factors. But most cases of melanoma are linked to exposure to UV light. 

[Melanom.org](http://www.melanoma.org/understand-melanoma/what-is-melanoma):

> Research suggests that approximately 90% of melanoma cases can be linked to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from natural or artificial sources, such as sunlight and indoor tanning beds. 

When found early, Melanoma is a very treatable disease. But as the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it becomes very difficult to contain. Luckily, by taking some simple precautions, it's easy to protect yourself. 

## How you can protect yourself

The primary way to protect yourself is to lessen your exposure to the harmful UV light. 

* Use sunscreen whenever you will be outside for an extended period of time. The sunscreen should be at least SPF 30 or greater and should be applied generously. 



It should also be reapplied approximately every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating
- Wear protective clothing like hats and UV protective shirts
- DO NOT BURN, severe sunburns increase your disk of developing skin cancer and each susceptive burn has a compounding effect on your change of developing skin cancer.
- Lastly, at all costs avoid tanning booths. Many studies have shown that tanning booths have a major effect on your chance of developing skin cancer

## Some key facts

From [EPA.gov](http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/doc/ia_facts_print.pdf)

- Between 1975â€“2006, the rate of new melanoma diagnoses in Iowa has more than tripled.
- About 82 people in Iowa die of melanoma every year.
- More people were diagnosed with skin cancer in 2009 than with breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer combined.
