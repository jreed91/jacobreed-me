Many people think that the name Adidas stands for "All Day I Dream About Sports (or Soccer)", but that's actually false. The actual reasoning for the name isn't as interesting as the story behind the founder and his brother. 

[Sports Legend Revealed: Did Adidas get its name from the acronym "All Day I Dream About Soccer"?](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/10/sports-legend-revealed-did-adidas-get-its-name-from-the-acronym-all-day-i-dream-about-soccer.html):

> The actual origin is tied to an acrimonious split between two German brothers in the wake of World War II.

>The brothers had quite different personalities, with Rudolf the bombastic salesman and Adolf the quiet shoe designer. They lived together in the same house with their wives during World War II and their relationship got more and more strained. When Rudolf was drafted into the German army, he believed that Adolf had pulled strings to get Rudolf out of his hair. Later, when Rudolf was captured by American soldiers and accused of being a member of SS (the armed force of the Nazi Party), he believed that Adolf had tipped the Americans off (Rudolf was cleared of the charges).

>In 1949, Adolf named his new company adidas (originally it was lowercase like that) after his nickname Adi and his last name Dassler. So Adi Dassler became adidas.

>Rudolf did the same thing with his company name, calling his new company Ruda (Rudolf Dassler). Soon after forming Ruda, though, he changed the name of the company to Puma, which remains its name today.
