I usually hate these "year in review" posts but this is a great roundup on what happened in 2014 and thoughts on 2015 from Fred Wilson.

>8/ we finally got rid of files. dropbox, google drive, soundcloud, spotify, netflix, hbogo, youtube, wattpad, kindle, and a host of other cloud based services finally killed off three letter filenames like mp3, mov, doc and xls.

This could be the most interesting change to me in this list. Kids no longer need to worry about what type a file it is. They no longer have mp3's on their phones, it's just music. This really began with the introduction of the iPhone and Steve's decision to hide the file system for the sake of simplicity. It has finally come full circle. It'll be interesting to see how Microsoft and Apple will handle this change for the Desktop. Will they finally hide file extensions?


[What Is Going To Happen – AVC](http://avc.com/2015/01/what-is-going-to-happen/):

>10/ cybersecurity budgets will explode in 2015 as every company, institution, and government attempts to avoid being Sony’d. 

I'd love to see some statistics on how much the enterprise is spending on security over the past few years. From personal experience, I know it's the top priority for many executives.
