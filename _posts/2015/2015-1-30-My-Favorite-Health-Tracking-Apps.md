I've become a bit of tracking freak. I track everything I eat, every step I take, how many miles I drive and everything in between. One of the areas I'm most focused on is Health. I have a few key apps that I use to track what I eat, how far I run, and all of my workouts.

## Running

I have been rotating between a few apps to track this particular. I first started off with Nike+ but have recently switched over to RunKeeper. RunKeeper has not become bloated with useless features. They have focused on making it quick and easy to track your runs.

RunKeeper also provides a ton of analytics on all of my runs. I can see how many runs I'm averaging each week, my average pace, and a ton of others. If you sign up for their Pro account you can get even deeper insights, as well as personal guidance on how to improve. [RunKeeper recently also announced a new partnership with Spotify](http://blog.runkeeper.com/3092/weve-got-the-musicfitness-experience-youve-been-begging-us-for/), which allows you to select your favorite playlists right from the app. Lastly, RunKeeper integrates with iOS Health, making sure all my data saved in a central location so that I can share that information with other apps. All of these features plus a clean look is why this is my running app of choice.

## Diet Tracking

Their are a lot of diet tracking apps on the App Store, but not many have the depth of a food database like myfitnesspal.

My main use of myfitnesspal is adding all the food I eat in a day and tracking my nutrition intake. Their are two big problems with food tracking apps; you have to remember to use it everyday and it has to be easy to add the food you eat. Myfitnesspal mostly fixes these issues. With over 4 million foods in their database it is one of the most comprehensive databases of food I have used. More often then not it will find the food I'm looking for with a quick search. In those unique instances when it can't you can easily scan the barcode of a product to quickly add it to the database. 

My biggest complaint about this app is tracking how much you eat. When you're adding a food you must select a serving. But most of these are in grams or ounces which is difficult to correlate to how much you actually ate.

## Strength Training

This is the area where I had the most difficulty in finding an app that fits my needs. Back in high school we would use printed cards to track all our workouts. It was perfect for tracking your weight and reps for exercises. But now that we're in the digital age I wanted something similar on my phone. I like being able to create my own routines instead of being confined to "expert" created routines. I tried A LOT of apps. Fittest, MetricMe, GymBook, and I'm sure a few others. The problem with all of them is that they we're too cumbersome to use. Menu after menu were needed just to add your reps to an exercise. After searching for a while I finally found Strong.

What makes Strong different from the rest is the simplicity. The most tedious part of the app is defining your routines. To create a routine, you add the exercises you want in it, the amount of reps and sets for each and you're done. By doing all the hard work up front, you can spend your workout just adding the amount of weight you did, instead of fiddling around with a bunch of menus. Strong can also keep track of your 1 rep max and a few other statistics. The simplicity of this app is what makes it my go to app. 

[Strong is free ](http://bit.ly/strongapp) with an optional in-app purchase to unlock the full app.
