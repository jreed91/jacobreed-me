[U.S. cancer deaths fell 22 percent since 1991 - Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/31/us-cancer-casualties-idUSKBN0K918220141231):

> More than 1.5 million Americans avoided death from cancer since 1991 thanks to falling smoking rates and better cancer prevention, detection and treatments, according to a study from the American Cancer Society.

This is a good sign that we are continuing to improve our methods for treating cancers. I think some of this can be attributed to targeted treatments like [Immunotherapy](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cancers-super-survivors-how-immunotherapy-is-transforming-oncology-1417714379). These treatments work by allowing the healthy T-cells to better recognize and attack the cancer cells. They are more focused on the DNA of the cancer and its effectiveness is different with everyone. In order to be more effective we must focus on the individual. 

But with these more personal and targeted approaces to therapy we face an uphill battle with being able to make these therapies available to everyone no matter their income level.

> Although the overall cancer death rate dropped over the past two decades, the researchers also found that not all Americans benefited equally. 

Targeted therapies are expensive and not everyone has insurance that can cover these drugs. In order to continue this trend, these drugs need to be available to everyone no matter the income level.
