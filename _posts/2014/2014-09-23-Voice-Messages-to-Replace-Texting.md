A new app released today called [talko](http://www.talko.com), is a new kind of app that focuses on using voice for communication. 


From [Medium](https://medium.com/talko-team-talk-share-do/welcome-to-talko-9e6ed73d7002?source=latest&):

>A tipping point is upon us. The phone, not the PC, is at the center of how we now communicate – although the ‘phone call’ has become an increasingly rare occurrence. We avoid ringing others and despise being rung and, quite frankly, the ‘phone app’ is languishing. Email is less-and-less our go-to tool (even at work), as more often we find it more natural to just pull out our phones and start tapping away. Our text-based conversations have become increasingly brief, with less depth and substance. Trying to convey emotion so tersely, we lean on emoji and stamps.

 Voice messaging is already hugely popular in Asian cultures, they use it more or less like a walkie talkie. With iOS 8 adding the ability to quickly send voice messages, I think we will see a huge increase in people using voice message as their main form of communication.
