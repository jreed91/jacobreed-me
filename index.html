        <p>Many people think that the name Adidas stands for “All Day I Dream About Sports (or Soccer)”, but that’s actually false. The actual reasoning for the name isn’t as interesting as the story behind the founder and his brother. </p>

<p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/10/sports-legend-revealed-did-adidas-get-its-name-from-the-acronym-all-day-i-dream-about-soccer.html">Sports Legend Revealed: Did Adidas get its name from the acronym “All Day I Dream About Soccer”?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual origin is tied to an acrimonious split between two German brothers in the wake of World War II.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brothers had quite different personalities, with Rudolf the bombastic salesman and Adolf the quiet shoe designer. They lived together in the same house with their wives during World War II and their relationship got more and more strained. When Rudolf was drafted into the German army, he believed that Adolf had pulled strings to get Rudolf out of his hair. Later, when Rudolf was captured by American soldiers and accused of being a member of SS (the armed force of the Nazi Party), he believed that Adolf had tipped the Americans off (Rudolf was cleared of the charges).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1949, Adolf named his new company adidas (originally it was lowercase like that) after his nickname Adi and his last name Dassler. So Adi Dassler became adidas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rudolf did the same thing with his company name, calling his new company Ruda (Rudolf Dassler). Soon after forming Ruda, though, he changed the name of the company to Puma, which remains its name today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 1.5 million Americans avoided death from cancer since 1991 thanks to falling smoking rates and better cancer prevention, detection and treatments, according to a study from the American Cancer Society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good sign that we are continuing to improve our methods for treating cancers. I think some of this can be attributed to targeted treatments like <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/cancers-super-survivors-how-immunotherapy-is-transforming-oncology-1417714379">Immunotherapy</a>. These treatments work by allowing the healthy T-cells to better recognize and attack the cancer cells. They are more focused on the DNA of the cancer and its effectiveness is different with everyone. In order to be more effective we must focus on the individual. </p>

<p>But with these more personal and targeted approaces to therapy we face an uphill battle with being able to make these therapies available to everyone no matter their income level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the overall cancer death rate dropped over the past two decades, the researchers also found that not all Americans benefited equally. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targeted therapies are expensive and not everyone has insurance that can cover these drugs. In order to continue this trend, these drugs need to be available to everyone no matter the income level.</p>

  <p>8/ we finally got rid of files. dropbox, google drive, soundcloud, spotify, netflix, hbogo, youtube, wattpad, kindle, and a host of other cloud based services finally killed off three letter filenames like mp3, mov, doc and xls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be the most interesting change to me in this list. Kids no longer need to worry about what type a file it is. They no longer have mp3’s on their phones, it’s just music. This really began with the introduction of the iPhone and Steve’s decision to hide the file system for the sake of simplicity. It has finally come full circle. It’ll be interesting to see how Microsoft and Apple will handle this change for the Desktop. Will they finally hide file extensions?</p>

<p>I’d love to see some statistics on how much the enterprise is spending on security over the past few years. From personal experience, I know it’s the top priority for many executives. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, Verizon is packaging and selling subscriber information, acting as a data broker on real-time advertising exchanges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially what Verizon is doing is injecting a unique identifier into each request you make. Since this being done at the application layer, there is no way for you to block it. The only thing that blocks this is by using SSL or VPN. You can check to see if you’re being injected <a href="http://uidh.crud.net">here</a>. </p>

  <p>Our team wanted to do something to improve this situation, so we built a system dedicated to further securing people’s Facebook accounts by actively looking for these public postings, analyzing them, and then notifying people when we discover that their credentials have shown up elsewhere on the Internet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great idea. Rather than being reactive Facebook is being proactive in notifying their users. Hopefully we can see more companies taking these types of measures. </p>
