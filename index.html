        <p>I’ve become a bit of tracking freak. I track everything I eat, every step I take, how many miles I drive and everything in between. One of the areas I’m most focused on is Health. I have a few key apps that I use to track what I eat, how far I run, and all of my workouts.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>I have been rotating between a few apps to track this particular. I first started off with Nike+ but have recently switched over to RunKeeper. RunKeeper has not become bloated with useless features. They have focused on making it quick and easy to track your runs. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lEML9DE.png" alt="Runkeeper" /></p>

<p>RunKeeper also provides a ton of analytics on all of my runs. I can see how many runs I’m averaging each week, my average pace, and a ton of others. If you sign up for their Pro account you can get even deeper insights, as well as personal guidance on how to improve. <a href="http://blog.runkeeper.com/3092/weve-got-the-musicfitness-experience-youve-been-begging-us-for/">RunKeeper recently also announced a new partnership with Spotify</a>, which allows you to select your favorite playlists right from the app. Lastly, RunKeeper integrates with iOS Health, making sure all my data saved in a central location so that I can share that information with other apps. All of these features plus a clean look is why this is my running app of choice. </p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runkeeper-gps-running-walk/id300235330?mt=8">RunKeeper is available for free on the App Store</a></p>

<h2 id="diet-tracking">Diet Tracking</h2>

<p>Their are a lot of diet tracking apps on the App Store, but not many have the depth of a food database like myfitnesspal. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/40iNh3N.jpg" alt="myfitnesspal" /></p>

<p>My main use of myfitnesspal is adding all the food I eat in a day and tracking my nutrition intake. Their are two big problems with food tracking apps; you have to remember to use it everyday and it has to be easy to add the food you eat. Myfitnesspal mostly fixes these issues. With over 4 million foods in their database it is one of the most comprehensive databases of food I have used. More often then not it will find the food I’m looking for with a quick search. In those unique instances when it can’t you can easily scan the barcode of a product to quickly add it to the database. </p>

<p>My biggest complaint about this app is tracking how much you eat. When you’re adding a food you must select a serving. But most of these are in grams or ounces which is difficult to correlate to how much you actually ate.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-diet-tracker/id341232718?mt=8">myfitnesspal is available for free on the App Store.</a></p>

<h2 id="strength-training">Strength Training</h2>

<p>This is the area where I had the most difficulty in finding an app that fits my needs. Back in high school we would use printed cards to track all our workouts. It was perfect for tracking your weight and reps for exercises. But now that we’re in the digital age I wanted something similar on my phone. I like being able to create my own routines instead of being confined to “expert” created routines. I tried A LOT of apps. Fittest, MetricMe, GymBook, and I’m sure a few others. The problem with all of them is that they we’re too cumbersome to use. Menu after menu were needed just to add your reps to an exercise. After searching for a while I finally found Strong. </p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XCEYYad.png" alt="Strong" /></p>

<p>What makes Strong different from the rest is the simplicity. The most tedious part of the app is defining your routines. To create a routine, you add the exercises you want in it, the amount of reps and sets for each and you’re done. By doing all the hard work up front, you can spend your workout just adding the amount of weight you did, instead of fiddling around with a bunch of menus. Strong can also keep track of your 1 rep max and a few other statistics. The simplicity of this app is what makes it my go to app. </p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/strongapp">Strong is free </a> with an optional in-app purchase to unlock the full app. </p>

        <p>Many people think that the name Adidas stands for “All Day I Dream About Sports (or Soccer)”, but that’s actually false. The actual reasoning for the name isn’t as interesting as the story behind the founder and his brother. </p>

<p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/10/sports-legend-revealed-did-adidas-get-its-name-from-the-acronym-all-day-i-dream-about-soccer.html">Sports Legend Revealed: Did Adidas get its name from the acronym “All Day I Dream About Soccer”?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual origin is tied to an acrimonious split between two German brothers in the wake of World War II.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brothers had quite different personalities, with Rudolf the bombastic salesman and Adolf the quiet shoe designer. They lived together in the same house with their wives during World War II and their relationship got more and more strained. When Rudolf was drafted into the German army, he believed that Adolf had pulled strings to get Rudolf out of his hair. Later, when Rudolf was captured by American soldiers and accused of being a member of SS (the armed force of the Nazi Party), he believed that Adolf had tipped the Americans off (Rudolf was cleared of the charges).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1949, Adolf named his new company adidas (originally it was lowercase like that) after his nickname Adi and his last name Dassler. So Adi Dassler became adidas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rudolf did the same thing with his company name, calling his new company Ruda (Rudolf Dassler). Soon after forming Ruda, though, he changed the name of the company to Puma, which remains its name today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 1.5 million Americans avoided death from cancer since 1991 thanks to falling smoking rates and better cancer prevention, detection and treatments, according to a study from the American Cancer Society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good sign that we are continuing to improve our methods for treating cancers. I think some of this can be attributed to targeted treatments like <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/cancers-super-survivors-how-immunotherapy-is-transforming-oncology-1417714379">Immunotherapy</a>. These treatments work by allowing the healthy T-cells to better recognize and attack the cancer cells. They are more focused on the DNA of the cancer and its effectiveness is different with everyone. In order to be more effective we must focus on the individual. </p>

<p>But with these more personal and targeted approaces to therapy we face an uphill battle with being able to make these therapies available to everyone no matter their income level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the overall cancer death rate dropped over the past two decades, the researchers also found that not all Americans benefited equally. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targeted therapies are expensive and not everyone has insurance that can cover these drugs. In order to continue this trend, these drugs need to be available to everyone no matter the income level.</p>

        <p>I usually hate these “year in review” posts but this is a great roundup on what happened in 2014 and thoughts on 2015 from Fred Wilson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8/ we finally got rid of files. dropbox, google drive, soundcloud, spotify, netflix, hbogo, youtube, wattpad, kindle, and a host of other cloud based services finally killed off three letter filenames like mp3, mov, doc and xls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be the most interesting change to me in this list. Kids no longer need to worry about what type a file it is. They no longer have mp3’s on their phones, it’s just music. This really began with the introduction of the iPhone and Steve’s decision to hide the file system for the sake of simplicity. It has finally come full circle. It’ll be interesting to see how Microsoft and Apple will handle this change for the Desktop. Will they finally hide file extensions?</p>

<p>I’d love to see some statistics on how much the enterprise is spending on security over the past few years. From personal experience, I know it’s the top priority for many executives. </p>

  <p>In short, Verizon is packaging and selling subscriber information, acting as a data broker on real-time advertising exchanges.</p>

<p>Essentially what Verizon is doing is injecting a unique identifier into each request you make. Since this being done at the application layer, there is no way for you to block it. The only thing that blocks this is by using SSL or VPN. You can check to see if you’re being injected <a href="http://uidh.crud.net">here</a>. </p>
