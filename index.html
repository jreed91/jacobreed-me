        <p>One year ago I wrote <a href="http://jacobreed.me/2014/05/09/Dad.html">this post</a>, on the day my father passed away. While this past year has been one of a lot of sadness, it also has brought new challenges and achievements. I <a href="http://jacobreed.me/2014/05/20/Graduation.html">graduated college</a>, began my career at HNI and ran the <a href="http://bix7.com/2014/results/index.php?get=results&amp;name=reed&amp;race=2014-bix&amp;submit=Search">Bix 7</a> for the first time. But, with the absence of my father it was difficult to make up for him not being around. As I wrote 1 year ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was Mr. Fix-It around our house. If one of our cars needed fixing he could do it. If the stove broke he would be the one we call. On top of all this, he was the one that cooked and cleaned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trying to fill this void was difficult since I’m not the handiest person. But we always had a friend or family member there to help out whenever something needed fixed and I can’t thank them enough for this. </p>

<p>I know my father would not want me to spend this day laying around being depressed. So instead, I want to use this post to provide resources and information about the disease that ultimately killed him. I’m hoping that someone out there can take this information and make a change in their own life, so that they don’t have to suffer from this terrible disease.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-melanoma">What is Melanoma</h2>
<p>Melanoma is usually a cancer of the skin but sometimes can be found in the eyes or in the mucous membranes. Many factors can lead to melanoma, including, your family history, genetics, and environmental factors. But most cases of melanoma are linked to exposure to UV light. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.melanoma.org/understand-melanoma/what-is-melanoma">Melanom.org</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research suggests that approximately 90% of melanoma cases can be linked to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from natural or artificial sources, such as sunlight and indoor tanning beds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When found early, Melanoma is a very treatable disease. But as the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it becomes very difficult to contain. Luckily, by taking some simple precautions, it’s easy to protect yourself. </p>

<h2 id="how-you-can-protect-yourself">How you can protect yourself</h2>

<p>The primary way to protect yourself is to lessen your exposure to the harmful UV light. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Use sunscreen whenever you will be outside for an extended period of time. The sunscreen should be at least SPF 30 or greater and should be applied generously. </li>
</ul>

<p>It should also be reapplied approximately every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating
- Wear protective clothing like hats and UV protective shirts
- DO NOT BURN, severe sunburns increase your disk of developing skin cancer and each susceptive burn has a compounding effect on your change of developing skin cancer.
- Lastly, at all costs avoid tanning booths. Many studies have shown that tanning booths have a major effect on your chance of developing skin cancer</p>

<h2 id="some-key-facts">Some key facts</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/doc/ia_facts_print.pdf">EPA.gov</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Between 1975–2006, the rate of new melanoma diagnoses in Iowa has more than tripled.</li>
  <li>About 82 people in Iowa die of melanoma every year.</li>
  <li>More people were diagnosed with skin cancer in 2009 than with breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer combined.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.midwestmelanoma.org">Midwest Melanoma Partnership</a>: A brand new partnership between multiple hospitals and clinics hoping to improve the diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma.</li>
  <li><a href="Melanoma Research Foundation">http://www.melanoma.org</a>: The leading organization dedicated to the treatment, diagnosis and education on Melanoma.</li>
  <li><a href="https://doctormoiowa.wordpress.com">Dr. Mo’s Blog</a>: A medical oncologist at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, Dr. Mo was a doctor of my father’s and has a truly inspiring story to tell. He also updates his blog regularly with stories on his patients and the challenges they face everyday. </li>

<p>Finally, if you want to help Melanoma research, please think about <a href="http://www.melanoma.org/get-involved/support-the-mrf">donating</a>. Even the smallest donation can go a long way in saving someone’s life. </p>

        <p>Many people think that the name Adidas stands for “All Day I Dream About Sports (or Soccer)”, but that’s actually false. The actual reasoning for the name isn’t as interesting as the story behind the founder and his brother. </p>

<p><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/10/sports-legend-revealed-did-adidas-get-its-name-from-the-acronym-all-day-i-dream-about-soccer.html">Sports Legend Revealed: Did Adidas get its name from the acronym “All Day I Dream About Soccer”?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual origin is tied to an acrimonious split between two German brothers in the wake of World War II.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brothers had quite different personalities, with Rudolf the bombastic salesman and Adolf the quiet shoe designer. They lived together in the same house with their wives during World War II and their relationship got more and more strained. When Rudolf was drafted into the German army, he believed that Adolf had pulled strings to get Rudolf out of his hair. Later, when Rudolf was captured by American soldiers and accused of being a member of SS (the armed force of the Nazi Party), he believed that Adolf had tipped the Americans off (Rudolf was cleared of the charges).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1949, Adolf named his new company adidas (originally it was lowercase like that) after his nickname Adi and his last name Dassler. So Adi Dassler became adidas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rudolf did the same thing with his company name, calling his new company Ruda (Rudolf Dassler). Soon after forming Ruda, though, he changed the name of the company to Puma, which remains its name today.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 1.5 million Americans avoided death from cancer since 1991 thanks to falling smoking rates and better cancer prevention, detection and treatments, according to a study from the American Cancer Society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good sign that we are continuing to improve our methods for treating cancers. I think some of this can be attributed to targeted treatments like <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/cancers-super-survivors-how-immunotherapy-is-transforming-oncology-1417714379">Immunotherapy</a>. These treatments work by allowing the healthy T-cells to better recognize and attack the cancer cells. They are more focused on the DNA of the cancer and its effectiveness is different with everyone. In order to be more effective we must focus on the individual. </p>

<p>But with these more personal and targeted approaces to therapy we face an uphill battle with being able to make these therapies available to everyone no matter their income level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the overall cancer death rate dropped over the past two decades, the researchers also found that not all Americans benefited equally. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targeted therapies are expensive and not everyone has insurance that can cover these drugs. In order to continue this trend, these drugs need to be available to everyone no matter the income level.</p>

        <p>I usually hate these “year in review” posts but this is a great roundup on what happened in 2014 and thoughts on 2015 from Fred Wilson.</p>

<p><a href="http://avc.com/2014/12/what-just-happened/">What Just Happened? – AVC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>8/ we finally got rid of files. dropbox, google drive, soundcloud, spotify, netflix, hbogo, youtube, wattpad, kindle, and a host of other cloud based services finally killed off three letter filenames like mp3, mov, doc and xls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be the most interesting change to me in this list. Kids no longer need to worry about what type a file it is. They no longer have mp3’s on their phones, it’s just music. This really began with the introduction of the iPhone and Steve’s decision to hide the file system for the sake of simplicity. It has finally come full circle. It’ll be interesting to see how Microsoft and Apple will handle this change for the Desktop. Will they finally hide file extensions?</p>

<p><a href="http://avc.com/2015/01/what-is-going-to-happen/">What Is Going To Happen – AVC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10/ cybersecurity budgets will explode in 2015 as every company, institution, and government attempts to avoid being Sony’d. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to see some statistics on how much the enterprise is spending on security over the past few years. From personal experience, I know it’s the top priority for many executives. </p>
